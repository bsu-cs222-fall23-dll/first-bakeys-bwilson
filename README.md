The program prompts a name from the user for a wikipedia article. The wikipedia article is then tested to see if the article exists, while printing out any url redirects. The program accesses the Wikipedia page and grabs the 13 most recent revisions, printing the usernames and the dates.

In order to access the program from command line: Run the Main  Class

In order to access the program using GUI: use the gradle extension Tasks -> Application -> Run
